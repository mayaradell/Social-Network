# Problem Statement
It is required to develop a social networking web based application that involves the use of the internet to
connect users with their friends, family and acquaintances.
Social media websites are not necessarily about meeting new people online, although this does happen.
Instead, they are primarily about connecting with friends, family and acquaintances you already have in real
life.
