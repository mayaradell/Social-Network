# Problem Statement
It is required to develop a social networking web based application that involves the use of the internet to
connect users with their friends, family and acquaintances.
Social media websites are not necessarily about meeting new people online, although this does happen.
Instead, they are primarily about connecting with friends, family and acquaintances you already have in real
life. 

# Stage I: Entity-Relationship diagram
Designing an entity relationship diagram for the social network database and entering the design using a data- modeling tool such as Diagram.

# Stage II: Signup/ login /logout/ profile edit
Implementing those features. Each user profile must have the following fields.
● First name * 

● Last name * 

● Nickname

● Password * 

● Phone Number(s)

● Email * 

● Gender * 

● Birthdate * 

● Profile picture: there is a default photo for each gender.

● Hometown


● Marital status: Single, Engaged or Married.

● About me.

# Stage III: Browsing Friends and Send or Accept Friend requests:
User should be able to add someone to his/her friend list. By sending friendship request to a buddy, this
buddy should view the friendship requests that he/she has got in a place with the number of friend requests. Notes:
### a. It's not required to have real time notification.
### b. The friend requests number should be viewed in all screens. With a link to page having list of
friend requests to accept/ reject them. c. Each user has a button “Friends” that will navigate to friends’ page and will list all friends for
logged in user. Friends’ names will be hyperlinked so clicking on any friend’s name will navigate to
his profile.
